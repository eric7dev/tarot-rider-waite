78 TAROT CARDS DECK GUIDE BOOKLET

Based upon the original and or authorized edition of the famous 78-card Tarot Deck
Original drawings by Pamela Colman Smith under the direction of Arthur Edward Waite

INTRODUCTION by Stuart R. Kaplan

Dr. Arthur Edward Waite (1857-1942) was a genuine scholar of occultism whose
published works include The Holy Kabbalah and The Key to the Tarot first issued in
England in in 1910. Waite utilized symbolism as the key to the Tarot pack.
In The Key to the Tarot he writes: The true tarot is symbolism; it speaks no other
language and offers on other signs. What are the Tarot cards about which Waite so
skillfully writes? What is the message of each card and when and where did these
fascinating cardboard symbols first originate ?

The precise origin of Tarot cards in antiquity remains obscure. Court de Gebelin
writing in LeMonde Primitifin 1781 advances the theory that Tarot cards derived
from an ancient Egyptian book, The Book of Thoth. Thoth was the Egyptian Mercury,
said to be one of the early Kings and the inventor of the hieroglyphic system.
Gebelin asserts that it is from the Egyptians and Gypsies that Tarotcards were
dispersed throughout Europe.

The emergence of Tarot cards in Europe predates by over five centuries the work
of Waite. A German monk, Johannes, describes a game called Ludas Cartarum played
in the year 1377. Covelluzzo, afifteenth-century chronicler, relates the
introduction into Viterbo of the game of cards in the year 1379.
                                             (1)

In the year 1369 playing cards are not mentioned in a decree issued by Charles VI
of France against various forms of gambling; however, 28 years later, the Prevot
of Paris, in an ordinance dated January 22 1397, forbids working people from
playing tennis ball, cards, or ninepins excepting only on holidays. It is generally
accepted that playing cards emerge in Europe in the latter half of the fourteenth
century probably first in Italy as a complete 78-card deck or some inventive genius
subsequently combined the 56 cards known as the Minor Arcana with the 22 esoteric
and emblematic Tarot cards known as the Major Arcana to form the 78-card pack.

During the fifteenth century Tarot cards were generally drawn or hand painted for
the princely houses of Northern Italy and France. Subsequently, the card packs
became more numerous because they were reproduced by techniques using wood cuts,
stencils and copper engraving. By the sixteenth century a modified Tarot pack
called the Tarot of Marseilles gained popularity.

There exists today, in the archives of the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris,
17 Major Arcana cards generally believed, probably erroneously, to have been
hand painted about the year 1392 by Jacquemin Gringonneur for Charles VI of France
These cards are likely of later Venetian origin, possibly mid-fteenth-century
Tarocchi of Venice cards.
                                             (2)

The Pierpont Morgan Library in New York City posseses 35 cards from a 78-card
Tarot deck dating from circa 1484 and believed to be the work of either Bonifacio
Bembo or Antonio Cicognara. This deck apparently belonged to Cardinal Ascanio
Maria Sforza (1445-1505) or to his mother Bianca Visconti Sforza and was probably
not intended for actual play but, instead, many have been merely a pictorial
representation of the times.

Other early European cards related to the Tarot pack include:

- Tarocchi of Mantegna deck comprising of 50 instructive cards in five series
of ten cards each;

- Tarocchi of Venice or Lombardi deck comprising of 78 cards including 22 Major
Arcana and 56 Lesser Arcana cards;

- Tarocchino of Bologna deck comprising of 62 cards, believed to have been invented
by Franco is Fibbla, Prince of Pisa, and containing 22 Major Arcana and only
40 numeral suit cards;

- Minchiate of Florence deck similar to the regular 78-card Tarot deck but enlarged
to 97 cards by the addition of the signs of the zodiac, the four elements and
three cardinal virtues.

Tarot fortune teling readings generally take into account not only the individual
divinatory meaning ofa card but also the proximity between two or more cards and
whether the card is upside down (which weakens, delays and even reverses the meaning).
                                             (3)

The brief descriptive title on each of the 22 Major Arcana cards serves as a catalyst
toward a broader and deeper meaning which the diviner seeks to express.
Tarot decks contain 78 cards divided into two major groups:
 - 22 Major Arcana Cards
 - 56 Lesser Arcana Cards
The 22 Major Arcana or emblematic cards comprise 21 cards numbered from XXI to I (21-1)
plus an unnumbered card known as The Fool (Le Mat and Le Fou in French).
The 22 Major Arcana are also referred trumps (atouts in French, atutti or trionfi
in Italian) signifying "above all".

The 56 Lesser Arcana cards contain four suits including the usual court cards:
King, Queen, Jack (Valet, Page) plus a fourth card, The Cavalier (Knight, Knave)
which is placed between the Queen and the Jack. The suits are generally Swords (Spades),
Batons or Wands (Clubs), Cups (Hearts) and Coins or Pentacles (Diamonds). Suit
origins are believed to represent the four estates of life during medieval times:
nobility or persons who held their rank by military service are symbolized by Swords;
peasants or working class people by Clubs, clergymen and statesmen by Cups;
and tradesmen and the industrial class by Coins.
                                             (4)

Today's ordinary decks of playing cards seemingly descend from the medieval Tarot decks.
As card playing increases in popularity the Major Arcana cards were dropped (except
for The Fool which was retained as The Joker) and Cavalier and Page were combined into
today's Jack, thus giving us the standard deck of fifty-two cards plus Joker.

During the past two centuries various important woirks have appeared on different
aspects of Tarot cards authored by Gebelin (1781), Etteilla (1783), Levi (1854),
Vaillant (1857), Mathers (1888), Papus (1889), Falconnier (1896), Wirth, Waite (1910),
Thierens, Case, Crowley (1944), Graylt (1960), Knight (1965), Moakley (1966),
Doane (1967), and Kaplan (1970).

Under the initiative and supervision of Waite, a unique 78-card Tarot pack known
as "Rider Deck" was drawn by Miss Pamela Colman Smith, an American girl who was a
fellow member of The Order of the Golden Dawn.

Miss Smith was brought up in Jamaica and during her early teens traveled with the stage
acting partnership of Terry and Henry Irving. By the age of twenty-one Miss Smith was
established in England a theatrical designer and illustrator. Her interest in the theatre
led to her collaboration with William Butler Yeats on stage designs. Subsequently,
she worked with his brother Jack Yeats on the illustration and publication of a small
magazine entitled The Broad Sheet before bringing out her own The Green Sheaf, which
was fled with ballads, pictures, folktales, and verses.
                                             (5)

The outstanding feature of the Rider Deck is that all of the cards, including the forty
pip cards (numeral cards Ace to 10 in each of four suits) are represented in emblematic
designs, which are readily suitable for divination. This is in contrast to the rigid forms
of Swords, Batons, Cups and Coins previously used in Tarot decks. Waite also believed
that The Fool, being un-numbered and representing O, should not be placed between
cards 20 and 21, and that it's more natural sequence fell in front of The Magician in
attribution to the first letter of the Hebrew Alphabet, Aleph.

Waite transposed the numbers of two Major Arcana cards: Strength (Force, Fortitude) more
frequently shown in other Tarot decks (in particular Muller's 1J) deck and Grimaud's
Tarot of Marseilles version--as XI, is instead shown in the Rider Deck as VII. Justice,
more generally shown as VIII, is designated by Waite as bearing number XI.
There is currently a phenomenal interest in Tarot for tune-telling cards. The serious
investigator seeks to employ the cards as a means of pla past into more meaningful
perspective, understand present, and revealing the alternatives that exist in the future.
Those less acquainted with Tarot cards are content to use them as a game and to indulge
in reading sat parties or in small private groups.
                                             (6)

From a collector's standpoint, Tarot cards are both colorful and interesting.

Tarot decks are currently sought by teenagers, students, home-makers, businessmen,
professionals, collectors indeed, persons from all walk of life. Newspapers, magazines,
radio, and television frequently comment on the Tarot vogue. Teenagers enjoy Tarot parties.
Adults attend Tarot luncheons, charitable benefits, and Tarot picnics at which cards
readings are performed. Hollywood has even indulged in the growing trend with popular
Tarot readers being present at parties to service the well-known guests.

One of the fascinating aspects about Tarot card is their personal affect upon the
individual who uses them. Waite successfully presents a new dimension to their meaning
in The Key to the Tarot. Any Tarot reader, be they a serious scholar or a person dabbling
in the occult, will benefit from Waite's insight and keen perception.

It will be seen that, except where there is an irresistible suggestion conveyed by the surface
meaning, that which is extracted from the Trumps Major by the divinatory art is at once
artificial and arbitrary, as it seems to me, in the highest degree. But of one order are the
mysteries of light and of an other are those of fantasy.

                                             (29)

CUPS are asumed to represent people with light brown hair and fair complexion; WANDS represent
those having yellow or red hair and blue eyes; SWORDS correspond to persons with dark brown hair
and possibly gray, hazel or even blue eyes; PENTACLES answer to very dark people. The procedure
is as follows:

Select the SIGNIFICATOR of the person or thing about whom or which the inquiry is made. It is
the card which, in the reader's judgement or experience, is the most representative, and is not,
therefore, of necessity the Magician or High Priestess mentioned in the official divinatory
meanings. Place the SIGNIFICATOR in the middle. Let the reader and Querent shuffle and cut the
remainder of the deck three times each.

Turn up the FIRST CARD; cover the Significator therewith, and say:
That covers him. This is the person or things general environment at the time, the influence
with which he is actuated all through.

Turn up the SECOND CARD; put it across him horizontally, and say:
This represents his obstacles. If it is a favorable card, it will be something good in itself,
but not productive of good in the long run.
                                             (30)

Turn up the THIRD CARD; place it above the head of the Significator, and say:
This crowns him. It represents
  a. the best that he can arrive at.
  b. his ideal in the matter.
  c. what he wants to make his own.
  d. but it is not his own at present.

Turn up the FOURTH CARD; place it below the feet of the Significator, and say:
This is beneath him. It is his own, that which he has to work with and can use.

Turn up the FIFTH CARD; place it on the side that the Significator is looking away from, and say:
This is behind him. It is the current from which he is passing away, and it may be
the past of the matter.

Turn up the SIXTH CARD; place it on the side that the Significator is facing, and say:
This is before him. It is the current that is coming into action and will operate in the
specific matter.

The first six cards (plus the Significator card) are now disposed in the form of a cross.
The next four cards are turned up in succession and placed to your right, one card above another.

The SEVENTH CARD signifies himself, his attitude and relation to the matter.
The EIGHTH CARD signifies his house, his environment in the affair the influence, people and
events about him.
The NINTH CARD signifies his hopes and fears.
                                             (31)

The TENTH CARD represents what will come. It is on this card that you concentrate your intuitive
powers, your experience and your memory respect to the official divinatory meaning attached
thereto. It should include whatsoever you may have divined from the other cards on the table,
including the Significator itself and concerning him or it, not excepting such lights upon higher
significance as might fall like sparks from heaven if the card which serves for the Oracle, the
card for reading, should happen to be a Trump Major.

Thus basing your calculations, if you obtain a decisive judgment the reading is over, and you
have only to formulate the result.

In conclusion , as regards the question of complexions, their allocation to the Suits need
not be taken conventionally. You can go by the temperament of a person; one who is exceedingly
dark maybe very energetic, and would be better represented by a Sword a Pentacle.
On the other hand, a very fair person who was as indolent and lethargic should allocated
to Cups rather than Wands.

Great facility may be obtained by this method in a comparatively short time, allowance being
always made for the gifts of the reader.
                                             (32)
